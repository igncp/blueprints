# Doubts and Summaries Templates

These are templates of doubts that can be customized for specific cases. Some
of these are relatively subjective questions but can help drawing a big
picture.

## System

- What are the main parts / modules of the system (at different levels)
- If any, what are the building blocks in common between the different modules
  of the system
- What configuration / actions are required to accomplish X
- What would happen if the module X fails because Y
- What is the configuration X used for
- What does the configuration value X mean
- How would the system need to change to support X
- How would the system need to change to replace X by Y
- How would the system need to change to remove feature X
- What updates could be done to improve performance in X
- What steps could be done (infrastructure, workflow, order of implementation)
  to optimize the quality / time of existing / unexisting feature X
- Can feature X be accomplished without changing the system (e.g. configuration)
- What is the best way to debug the value / flow X

## Issue

- Under what key circunstances does the issue happen
- Under what key circunstances does the issue NOT happen
- What is the least ammount of setup to replicate the issue

## Summaries

- Describe the states and transitions of an hypotetical state machine of the main system
