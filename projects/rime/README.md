- Projects: https://rime.im/code/
    - The projects which I am currently most interested in are `librime` (core in C++), `plum` (the configuration manager and schema), and `ibus-rime` (the Linux client).
    - There is also the [main website](https://github.com/rime/home) which is using [hexo](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo)

- Current research:
    - [./ibus-rime.md](./ibus-rime.md)
    - [./ibus.md](./ibus.md)
    - [./librime.md](./librime.md)
    - [./plum.md](./plum.md)

- One important third-party dependency is [`OpenCC`](https://github.com/BYVoid/OpenCC) (Open Chinese Connect) which allows transforming between simplified and traditional characters.
