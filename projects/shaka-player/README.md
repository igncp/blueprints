  - [936](https://github.com/google/shaka-player/issues/936): Accept a `Date` type as start time (along with `Number`) for live streams. Doing a quick overview seems the place to implement the changes are in player and playhead. Not sure yet how the offset would be calculated (where to get the live edge date in live streams, seems that in the manifest (683))
  - [1201](https://github.com/google/shaka-player/issues/1201): Expose a new method in the `Player` API to allow updating the manifests URI. There is a workaround in the issue
