1. What is the default behavior for stream selection?

By default, ffmpeg includes only one stream of each type (video, audio,
subtitle) present in the input files and adds them to each output file.  It
picks the "best" of each based upon the following criteria:

- video: highest resolution
- audio: with most channels
- subtitles: the first subtitle stream

Where several streams of the same type rate equally, the stream with the lowest
index. For full manual control, use the "-map" option, which disables the
defaults.
