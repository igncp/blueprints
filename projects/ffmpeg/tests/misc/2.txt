2. How is the documentation organized

There are several websites hosting different parts of the documentation. The
official website main documentation page
(https://ffmpeg.org/documentation.html) is divided in:

- Command Line Tools documentation
- Components documentation (high-level topics)
- Libraries documentation
- General documentation (FAQ, platform-specific, etc.)
- API documentation (generated by Doxygen)
- Community Contributed documentation (official, tutorials, etc.)
- Books
