5. Describe the Opus codec

- Opus is a lossy audio coding format developed by the Xiph.Org Foundation and standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
- Several blind listening tests have ranked it higher-quality than any other standard audio format at any given bitrate until transparency is reached, including MP3, AAC, and HE-AAC
- Its delay is exceptionally low compared to competing codecs
- As an open format standardized through RFC, a reference implementation called libopus is available under the New BSD License
- The GitHub repo: https://github.com/xiph/opus
