This logs are in chronological order from bottom to top:

- Overread the `Reference.md` file to understand some basic methods and read all the examples in the `README.md` file. After, overread all the cases described in `PATTERNS.md`

- First thing after cloning the repo is reading the dependencies for production and an overview of the dir structure, adding it to the notes. Also make some discoverability in the exposed API.
