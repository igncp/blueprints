# Tests

The repository uses `.vader` files. This framework is from the same person:
https://github.com/junegunn/vader.vim . These tests contain a `include`
directory with the setup of the tests and a `run` file to start the runner.

The `run` script is just opening Vim in a similar fashion as the `.travis.yml`
file.
