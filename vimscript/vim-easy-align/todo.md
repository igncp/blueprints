# TO-DO

## Unit

- Investigate the two failing tests in the setup
- Flows of the main / complex source functions [requires understanding arguments]:
    - `s:interactive`
    - `s:process`
    - `s:parse_args`
    - `s:do_align`
- List of all the functions in autoload with explanations
- List of the important variables in autoload with explanations
- Create fixtures in the setup to learn the different alingment options: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-easy-align#list-of-options
- Retrieve the meaning of some of the arguments (in source.md)

## Frequent

- Revisit docs: Main README.md, EXAMPLES.md, easy_align.txt
- Use fixtures to test as many features
    - Add `echo` commands through the code to debug
- Flows and Stacks
- Revisit notes: Refactor, fix, study

## Doubts

- What is the `g:easy_align_last_command` variable used for
- In what format is the last command saved
- What are bang interactive modes used for
- If I want to align by one custom delimeter (e.g. `a`) how to do it
- What is `ignore_groups` refering to in the source

## Goals

- Get a thourough understanding of the library
