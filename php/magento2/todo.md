# TODO

- Find a Docker image (or compose.yml) with a Magento instance where it is possible to SSH 
    - Tried installing one with compose but failed when installing
    - Try custom PHP env and install via CLI: Will take time
    - Can test other PHP features
- Inspect directories in first levels of `app` and `lib`
- Do a summary of some of the directories under framework and app
- Setup PHP debugger
    - Start with VSCode with a base page (no Magento) 
    - On future step can research Web-based debuggers / and Magento debugging

## Periodic

- Read a section of the Official Developer docs: https://devdocs.magento.com/#/individual-contributors
