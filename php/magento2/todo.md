- Inspect directories in first levels of `app` and `lib`
- Do a summary of some of the directories under framework and app
- Investigate which unit tests are failing
- Manage to debug with Xdebugger
    - Try from container (e.g. from a CLI client) or from host (e.g. browser extension or VS Code)

## Periodic
